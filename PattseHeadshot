Description : I actively contributing as a Full Stack Developer to a dynamic gaming app called
PATT SE HEADSHOT, a platform that facilitated user participation in BGMI gaming contests with
corresponding monetary rewards based on their in-game performance. The project focused on
creating an engaging user experience by implementing a role-based user interface tailored to
different user categories.
This project placed a primary emphasis on delineating distinct roles: Administrator, Spectator,
and Standard User. The application was engineered to enable users to participate in diverse
Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI) gaming competitions encompassing Squad, Duo, and Solo
matches.
A pivotal feature enhancing the application's user-friendliness entails the capability for users,
upon contest registration, to extend invitations to their acquaintances, to join them in the
contest. Moreover, users retain the capacity to manage records associated with friends they
had previously invited.
