Description : I played a pivotal role in the development of an innovative project centered
around a QR-based authenticated attendance system. This system introduced a seamless and
secure approach to recording attendance through QR code scanning. The project revolved
around a unique concept, ensuring attendance accuracy while promoting user convenience.
In this project integrated QR code functionality into the attendance system. Users were
required to scan a QR code provided within the application to register their attendance.
Implemented a sophisticated authentication mechanism that ensured the legitimacy of
attendance records. QR code scanning was permitted only once within a specified 12-hour
window, effectively preventing duplicate or fraudulent attendance entries.
